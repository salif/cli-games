# How to Install?

Installation is very simple.

```bash
#Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/salif/cli-games.git
cd cli-games
#install the dependences for the games (for Unix systems and Lunix)
bash install-games.sh
```

# How to Play?
### for windows
After cloning, run `dir` to get a list of available directories of games. Then navigate to your favourite game using the `cd` command

**Eg:** `cd Hangman`

Read the **README** file in the respective directory to get more instruction about installation and playing.
Most of the games support different languages (including `node-js` and `python`) and the choice is yours!

### for Unix/Linux
just type
```sh
bash games.sh
```
and select the game by the number or 'e' for exit. If a game has a JS and Python version, you can choose which one you prefer you to play

## Creating new games

Before creating a new game, please check if it is available already, or somebody is working on creating that game. Then make sure to create a new issue to make sure others are OK with it. If you got approval for your suggestion, then move one! Code your game and create a PR with the new changes. We'll be happy to introduce your new game :smile:

**This project is driven on community basis. So we are happy to accept your contributions a lot!**
