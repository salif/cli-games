# How to Install?

Installation is very simple.

```bash
#Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/salifm/cli-games.git
cd cli-games
```

# How to Play?

After cloning, run `ls` _(or `dir` on Windows)_ to get a list of available directories of games. Then navigate to your favourite game using the `cd` command

**Eg:** `cd Hangman`

Read the **README** file in the respective directory to get more instruction about installation and playing.
Most of the games support different languages (including `node-js` and `python`) and the choice is yours!

## Creating new games

Before creating a new game, please check if it is available already, or somebody is working on creating that game. Then make sure to create a new issue to make sure others are OK with it. If you got approval for your suggestion, then move one! Code your game and create a PR with the new changes. We'll be happy to introduce your new game :smile:

**This project is driven on community basis. So we are happy to accept your contributions a lot!**
