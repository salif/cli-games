### ðŸŒ€ New Feature: Random Maze Mode (2025/05/14)

We've added a brand new **Random Maze Mode**!

When starting game, you can press **2** to enter this mode. In this mode, the game will generate a random maze for you to escape from. Each time you play, you'll face a different maze layout, making the game even more challenging and exciting.

But if you prefer the classic experience, you can still choose the **1** option to play the original maze.

No more predictable maps â€” enjoy endless variety!

### Creating a new map

Before starting to create a new map, please read this guidelines.

- `maps.json` is the file that is responsible for holding all the maps. Note this is a `.json` file so you should be familiar with it's syntax.
- `maps` is the root node of our file. Therefore it is the place you have to add the map.
- The file doesn't follow a strict rule. Here is an example of how you can add a new story to the file

```json
    {
        "maps": [
            ...
            [
                ["â™Ÿ", " "],
                [" ", "â–£"]
            ],
        ]
    }
```

- <b>Note that you must enter the player character (`"â™Ÿ"`) and the door (`"â–£"`) into the map to make it a valid map</b>
- You can also specify walls using `"â–‰"` character.

- Enjoy!
